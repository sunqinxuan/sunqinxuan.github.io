## ABSTRACT

A target tracking approach is proposed for mobile robots in this
paper to address the human-robot coexistence and collaboration
problem. The improved social force model (SFM) is applied to improve
the tracking performance of the robot in crowded environments.
When the robot approaches the pedestrians or obstacles,
the tracking strategy is adaptively adjusted to avoid collision. The
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is used to learn the parameters
of the improved SFM, where the training data for the IRL is
collected in real-world scenes. An effective criterion is designed
to evaluate the tracking performance, which fully considers the
relationship between the robot and surrounding environments. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
target tracking method.
