## Abstract

In this paper, the RGB-D camera-based simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) of indoor environments
is addressed using plane features. The plane parameter
space (PPS) is defined for a compact representation of
planes in the Cartesian space. The statistical information
grid (STING) structure is constructed in the PPS to extract
plane features. The plane association graph is developed to
determine the correspondences between the plane features
from two successive scans. The RGB-D camera pose is directly
calculated using the matched plane features if they
can provide sufficient constraints for the pose estimation.
Otherwise, a novel STING-based scan matching method is
developed in the PPS to achieve a full six degrees of freedom
camera pose estimation. The proposed method uses
only the plane features independent of any other features
to estimate the RGB-D camera poses and can thus be suitable
for some challenging scenes. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed plane feature-based RGB-D
SLAM can achieve high accuracy and robustness in both
on-board and hand-held applications.
