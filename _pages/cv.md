Projects
======
* **CICV Research Project on Semantic SLAM Algorithm for AVP**
  * Intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of surrounding fish-eye cameras.
  * Development of image stitching algorithm for Around View Monitor on the vehicle.
  * Development of the front-end (including Semantic-GICP-based scan matching, detection of the degenerate cases, region-grow-based line segment extraction, etc.) and back-end (a Ceres-based pose graph optimization framework) modules of the semantic SLAM system.

* **Environmental Perception and Mapping for Tightly-Coupled Air-Ground Cooperation using Multi-source and Heterogeneous Data** (Natural Science Foundation of China)
  * Development of the joint association and optimization of multiple geometric features (planes and lines) based on the interpretation tree structure (published on TIM).
  * Development of the SLAM system based on the multi-feature fusion.
* **Environmental Perception via Tightly-Coupled Multi-Sensor and Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Cooperation** (Tianjin Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars)
  * Quantitative analysis of how multiple geometric features constraining the sensor pose estimation.
  * Development of the seamless fusion framework of (plane-line-point) multimodal features (published on T-ASE).
