Hi! I’m Qinxuan Sun (孙沁璇). 

<hr>

I received my Ph.D and M.A. in Control Science and Engineering from the [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/) at Nankai University, supervised by Prof. [Jing Yuan](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/4199.htm), and my B.A. in Electronic Information Engineering at Beihang University. 

My research focuses on [simultaneous localization and mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) in robotics, with in-depth studies on pose estimation, constraint analysis and geometric feature parameterization methods.

I am currently an assistant researcher at Zhejiang Lab, where I am primarily responsible for key research tasks in several national projects. My research mainly includes visual navigation, inertial navigation, and magnetic compensation.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to check out my [academic papers](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/publications/) and [research projects](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/projects/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading detective novels, practicing Chinese calligraphy, painting and occasionally writing poetry or book reviews. If you also enjoy these activities, feel free to click [this link](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/literature/) and also my [portfolio](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/portfolio/) to see more.
