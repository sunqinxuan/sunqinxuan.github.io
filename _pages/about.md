Hi! I’m Qinxuan Sun (孙沁璇). 

I received my Ph.D and M.A. in Control Science and Engineering from the [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/) at Nankai University, supervised by Prof. [Jing Yuan](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/4199.htm), and my B.A. in Electronic Information Engineering at Beihang University. My research focuses on the [simultaneous localization and mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) for mobile robots. I am now a Research Assistant at Zhejiang Lab, where my work is mainly on the navigation, geomagnetism, and optimization. If you are interested at my research or my work, please have a look at the [publications](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/publications/) and [research projects](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/projects/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading detective novels, practicing Chinese calligraphy, painting and occasionally writing poetry or book reviews. If you also enjoy these activities, feel free to click [this link](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/literature/) and also my [portfolio](https://sunqinxuan.github.io/portfolio/) to see more.
