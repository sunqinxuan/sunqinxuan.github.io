Hi! I’m Qinxuan Sun (孙沁璇). 

I received my Ph.D and M.A. in Control Science and Engineering from the [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/) at Nankai University, and my B.A. in Electronic Information Engineering at Beihang University, supervised by Prof. [Jing Yuan](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/4199.htm). My research focuses on the [simultaneous localization and mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) for mobile robots.

I am now a Research Assistant at Zhejiang Lab. And my recent work is mainly on the navigation, geomagnetism, and optimization.
