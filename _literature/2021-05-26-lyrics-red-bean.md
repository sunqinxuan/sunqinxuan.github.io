<br>

还没好好地感受

I wish I could feel you with my heart,

雪花绽放的气候

while the snowflakes are fluttering around.

我们一起颤抖

Taking the chill off in a long embrace,

会更明白什么是温柔

we know sincerely about the tenderness.

<br>

还没跟你牵着手

I wish we could walk hand in hand,

走过荒芜的沙丘

across an immortal wasteland.

可能从此以后

I know it may become a chance,

学会珍惜天长和地久

from which we learn what truly lasts.

<br>

有时候，有时候

Sometimes I believe

我会相信一切有尽头

that everything can be seen to the end.

相聚离开都有时候

Getting used to the frequent gathering and parting,

没有什么会永垂不朽

I see nothing lasts for ever.

<br>

可是我，有时候

But sometimes I feel

宁愿选择留恋不放手

a bit reluctant to leave.

等到风景都看透

Maybe collected happiness along the way

也许你会陪我看细水长流

yields a settled peacefulness that ever stays.

<br>

还没为你把红豆

I wish I could turn the red bean

熬成缠绵的伤口

into a metaphor for the lingering heart.

然后一起分享

If the lovesickness could share,

会更明白相思的哀愁

maybe you could feel the melancholy alike.

<br>

还没好好地感受

I wish I could feel to the most

醒着亲吻的温柔

the tender kisses while awake.

可能在我左右

Maybe once by my side,

你才追求孤独的自由

you will seek for the long-lost loneliness.

<br>

有时候，有时候

Sometimes I believe

我会相信一切有尽头

that everything can be seen to the end.

相聚离开都有时候

Getting used to the frequent gathering and parting,

没有什么会永垂不朽

I see nothing lasts for ever.

<br>

可是我，有时候

But sometimes I feel

宁愿选择留恋不放手

a bit reluctant to leave.

等到风景都看透

Maybe collected happiness along the way

也许你会陪我看细水长流

yields a settled peacefulness that ever stays.
