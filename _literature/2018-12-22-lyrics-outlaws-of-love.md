《Outlaws Of Love》英译中：

<br>

Oh, nowhere left to go.

穷途无路退，

Are we getting closer? Closer?

以沫且相濡。

No, all we know is "No".

却道相濡亦无路，

Nights are getting colder, colder.

愈添寒夜苦。

<br>

Hey, tears all fall the same, 

闻言相向泪落，

We all feel the rain.

身披无情风雨。

We can't change...

知也无能为。

<br>

Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun.

万里经行处，不改向阳心。

Nowhere to grow old, we're always on the run.

无从共偕老，仓皇倚寒衾。

They say we'll rot in Hell, but I don't think we will.

我辈本无罪，讵可忍苦行？

They've branded us enough, "Outlaws of Love".

至矣久屈厄，亡命却因情。

<br>

Scars make us who we are.

一痕苦痛一念我，

Hearts and homes are broken, broken.

几回心离又家破。

Far, we could go so far.

孑然不觉江湖远，

With our minds wide open, open.

心之所至终不惑。

<br>

Hey, tears all fall the same.

至此俱是泪落，

We all feel the rain.

任其无情风雨。

We can't change...

知也无能为。

<br>

Everywhere we go we're looking for the sun.

万里经行处，拳拳不改向阳心。

Nowhere to grow old, we're always on the run.

无从共偕老，夜夜仓皇倚寒衾。

They say we'll rot in Hell, but I don't think we will.

我辈本无罪，奈何累世忍苦行？

They've branded us enough, "Outlaws of Love".

至矣久屈厄，天涯亡命却因情。

<br>

Outlaws of Love.

呜呼情之亡命。
