## 执迷不悔  Obsession with no Regret

<br>

*谱曲：袁惟仁*

*编曲：唐奕聪*

*填词：王菲*

*翻译：SqX*

<br>

这一次我执着面对

This time I look everything in the face,

任性地沉醉

losing myself in the caprice.

我并不在乎

I don't care whether

这是错还是对

it is correct or otherwise.

就算是深陷

Even though I'm in it up to the chin.

我不顾一切

Against all odds, I'll struggle out of the net.

就算是执迷

You said it was an obsession.

我也执迷不悔

Then it is the obsession with no regret.

<br>

别说我应该放弃

Don't tell me to give up,

应该睁开眼

and to keep a clear head.

我用我的心

It is with my heart

去看去感觉

that I'm gonna see and sense.

你并不是我

You're not in my shoes,

又怎能了解

so how can you possibly comprehend.

就算是执迷

You said it was an obsession.

让我执迷不悔

Then let me be obsessed with no regret.

<br>

我不是你们想得如此完美

Far from being perfect, I'm not living for your sake.

我承认有时也会辨不清真伪

Sometimes it is hard to tell the true from the fake.

并非我不愿意走出迷堆

It is not like I'm ready to get lost in the maze.

只是这一次

It is just because

这次是自己而不是谁

I want to be the master of my own fate.

<br>

要我用谁的心去体会

What can I rely on, apart from my own heart,

真真切切的感受周围

to give a real sense of the world around.

就算痛苦 就算是泪

Regardless of the sorrows and tears,

也是属于我的伤悲

I'd rather feel the grief to the fullest.

<br>

我还能用谁的心去体会

I can rely on nothing but my own heart

真真切切地感受周围

to give a real sense of the world around.

就算疲倦 就算是累

Regardless of all the weariness,

也只能执迷而不悔

I want to be obsessed with no regret.
