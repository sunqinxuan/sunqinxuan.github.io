<br>

心属于你的

我借来寄托

I commend my soul to you for comfort,

却变成我的心魔

which, however, has become my complex.

你属于谁的

我刚好经过

I chance to meet you, 

who come as if from nowhere,

却带来潮起潮落

drowning in the endless life ebb and flow.

<br>

都是因为一路上（一路上）

大雨曾经滂沱

I have felt the torrential rain along the way,

证明你有来过

which says you have been here once.

可是当我闭上眼

再睁开眼

When I open my eyes after a short meditation, 

只看见沙漠

哪里有什么骆驼

I seem to see camels disappearing into the sand.

<br>

背影是真的

人是假的

没什么执着

How senseless it is 

to cling to a receding figure.

一百年前

你不是你

我不是我

Everything may change 

in one hundred years.

悲哀是真的

泪是假的

本来没因果

I don't care how the karma works,

though tears seem to reveal the grief.

一百年后

没有你

也没有我

Everything can be washed away

in one hundred years.

<br>

风属于天的 

我借来吹吹 

I keep going with the wind,

却吹起人间烟火

arousing earthly joys and sorrows.

天属于谁的 

我借来欣赏 

Looking up in the sky,

I want to find peace in my heart.

却看到你的轮廓

Yet all I can see is your figure coming back.

<br>

都是因为一路上（一路上）

大雨曾经滂沱 

I have felt the torrential rain along the way,

证明你有来过

which says you have been here once.

可是当我闭上眼 

再睁开眼

When I open my eyes after a short meditation, 

只看见沙漠 

哪里有什么骆驼

I seem to see camels disappearing into the sand.

<br>

背影是真的 

人是假的

How senseless it is 

to cling to a receding figure.

though tears seem to reveal the grief.

in one hundred years.
