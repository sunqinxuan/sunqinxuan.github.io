喃喃诉底事，执手问红妆：

<br>

I wanna move with the seasons, go with the flow 

与时共推移，随波亦逐浪，

Take it easy, and let stuff go.

世情纷繁处，切莫费思量。

<br>

I wanna sleep like a baby, and rise with the sun.

长夜赤子梦，晨起迎朝阳，

Kick it all back, and get nothing done.

毋问身外事，形役卸仓皇。

<br>

I wanna make this day, the longest day.

欲将今时此日，尽付漫漫岁月长。

With a warmth that delivers happiness.

以此拳拳热忱，遥递欢愉永未央。

<br>

If only for today, I wanna be the girl who got away.

若得浮生半日，悄然遁逸凡尘世。

The lover who really loved.

凭爱憎随心，任其情缘自相因。

The dancer who danced to the last song.

且轻歌舞曼，直至曲终人亦散。

<br>

Don't wanna take sides.

咄咄向谁辩，遑论是与非。

Don't wanna make sense of pounds and pence.

营营苦思虑，终久归式微。

<br>

I want to be alone, don’t wanna hide.

一心远人居，非使隐庭帏，

Don’t want to be talked over, or walked upon.

何苦诉执念，亦或漠然归。

<br>

I want to think the heart is bigger than the head.

莫以形骸自缚，此心寰宇竞相晖。

Wanna follow you but not be led.

何故亦趋亦步，不若同行暂相随。

<br>

If only for today, I wanna be the girl who got away.

若得浮生一刻，忍将羁縻抛身侧。

The lover who really loved.

愿真情由衷，任其聚散苦匆匆。

The dancer who danced to the last song.

且踏歌舞蹈，直至苍茫岁月老。

<br>

I know what it's like to be passed over.

自知丘壑浅，从来皆落寞。

To go unnoticed, to be clumsy get things wrong.

往还无人问，行事鲁且拙。

And I know what it's like to arrive too late.

或属晚来客，茫然身无措。

To be told to leave, to be walked upon.

不堪相驱遣，徒论世情薄。

<br>

If only for today, I wanna be the girl who got away.

若得浮生一梦，万般色相终成空。

The lover who really loved.

纵相逢有期，自古惺惺却相惜。

The dancer who danced to the last song.

且清夜起舞，舞尽娑婆尘世苦。
