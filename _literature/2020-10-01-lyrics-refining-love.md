《修炼爱情》中译英

## 修炼爱情  Refining Love

<br>

*填词：易家扬*

*谱曲：林俊杰*

*编曲：吴庆隆*

*翻译：SqX*

<br>

凭什么要失望

Why am I disappointed?

藏眼泪到心脏

Tears should be buried.

往事不会说谎 别跟它为难

No need to struggle in memories.

我们两人之间不需要这样

No need for us to be like this.

我想

Indeed.

<br>

修炼爱情的心酸

Grieved by refining love,

学会放好以前的渴望

try to hide the desires of the past.

我们那些信仰 要忘记多难

Long gone the beliefs of us,

it's hard to give up.

<br>

远距离的欣赏 近距离的迷惘

Admiration from afar seems complicated 

once we stand close by.

谁说太阳会找到月亮

The sun can't appear in the moonlight.

别人有的爱 我们不可能模仿

Stop looking at others, 

our stories won't be alike.

<br>

修炼爱情的悲欢

Both the sorrow and joy of refining love imply

我们这些努力不简单

that our hard works are not in vain.

快乐炼成泪水 是一种勇敢

Joys turning into tears,

says all along we've been brave.

<br>

几年前的幻想 几年后的原谅

A few years' haunting fantasy

is finally relieved in forgiveness.

为一张脸去养一身伤

The departure of you inflicts on me a heavy wound.

别讲想念我 我会受不了这样

Stop saying about missing me, 

it's hard to endure what I've been through.

<br>

记忆它真嚣张

I've been drowned in memories.

路灯把痛点亮

The evening lights seem to emphasize the grief.

情人一起看过多少次月亮

How many times have we seen the moon arise?

它在天空看过多少次遗忘

While the moon is always there, 

seeing people drifting away,

多少心慌

and growing uneasy.

<br>

笑着说爱让人疯狂

Sometimes I laugh at the love that drive me crazy.

哭着说爱让人紧张

Sometimes I can't help weeping for its delicacy.

忘不了那个人就投降

There's no way but to surrender

to the love deeply rooted in my memory.
