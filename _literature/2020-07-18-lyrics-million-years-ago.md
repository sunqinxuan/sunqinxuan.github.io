## Million Years Ago 光阴如过隙

<br>

*Produced By: Greg Kurstin*

<br>

I only wanted to have fun,
Learning to fly, learning to run.

欲度流年以欢愉，接飞猱而骋奔鹿。

I let my heart decide the way
When I was young

以其年少而恣性，任随心而去住。

<br>

Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable.

然自省以深谙，无免之于痛楚。

To earn my stripes I'd have to pay,
And bear my soul.

欲求立身而显达，莫怨性灵之寡助。

<br>

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done.

世人皆难如意，自悔恨而无绪。

Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflections that they see.

似我谁其与共？深其思虑而龃龉。

<br>

I wish I could live a little more,
Look up to the sky, not just the floor.

望沧海而至星辰，遣韶光以尽意。

I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry.

叹日月之如梭，徒凝睇而泣涕。

<br>

I miss the air, I miss my friends,
I miss my mother; I miss it when

思至亲于往事，念念以成追忆。

Life was a party to be thrown.
But that was a million years ago.

彼时欢娱而日短，回首光阴如过隙。

<br>

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet.

曾为抚畜以安身，试寻迹于故地。

They can't look me in the eye.
It's like they're scared of me.

皆相见而回避，惶惶乎若悚惧。

<br>

I try to think of things to say,
Like a joke or a memory.

我亦踟蹰而忘言，徒强笑以追忆。

But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day.

曾不复如初之相识，独日色如常而煦煦。

<br>

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done.

世人皆难如意，自悔恨而无绪。

Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be.

似我谁其与共？失初心而难续。

<br>

I wish I could live a little more,
Look up to the sky, not just the floor.

望沧海而至星辰，遣韶光以尽意。

I feel like my life is flashing by.
And all I can do is watch and cry.

叹日月之如梭，徒凝睇而泣涕。

<br>

I miss the air, I miss my friends,
I miss my mother, I miss it when

思至亲于往事，念念而成追忆。

Life was a party to be thrown.
But that was a million years ago.

彼时欢娱而日短，回首光阴如过隙。

<br>

A million years ago.

光阴如过隙。
