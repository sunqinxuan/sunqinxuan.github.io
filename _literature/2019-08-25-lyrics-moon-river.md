《Moon River》英译中

## Moon River 月之河

<br>

*Composer: Henry Mancini*

*Lyricist: Johnny Mercer*

*originally performed by Audrey Hepburn*

*translated by SqX*

<br>

Moon river, wider than a mile

有河名月，波横一里

I'm crossing you in style some day

凌波有日，盈盈渡彼

Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker

愿言伤怀，维梦之始

Wherever you're going, I'm going your way

任尔漂泊，永随不止

Two drifters, off to see the world

天涯咫尺，共尔漂泊

There's such a lot of world to see

山明水阔，红尘几何

We're after the same rainbow's end, 
waiting round the bend

步河之湾，逐虹之末

My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me

共尔漂泊，共月之河
