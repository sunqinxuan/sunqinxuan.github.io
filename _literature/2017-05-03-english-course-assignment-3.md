English Course Assignment 3 - Hero

## My Personal Hero

I put a word "personal" before "hero", because I think everyone has his/her own hero. My personal hero is my mother. Her name is Ge Xia, where Ge is her surname, and Xia is the given name that means rosy clouds. However, Ge is not her true surname. She was adopted after her birth. Fortunately her adoptive parents were both kind hearted and were good to her. She has a strong character and a kind heart, and she is also an excellent accountant.

I remembered that in the novel *Gone with the Wind*, Scarlett has described her mother Ellen in this way: "She had never seen her mother stirred from her austere placidity, nor her personal appointments anything but perfect, no matter what the hour of day or night." That was the exact impression of my mother when I was a child. She appeared to be beautiful and elegant, and I always tried to imitate her. I was too young then to understand the hardness of life as well as her personal strength.

My mother's life was full of ups and downs. Her adoptive mother died at a young age. And one of her brothers who was spoiled kept finding fault with her. A lot of bad things had happened to her in those years. But she just bore the misfortunes and frustrations with patience, while taking care of all the families. She nursed her adoptive father when he was severely ill until he died, and provided me with a happy and carefree childhood. 

I know that for other people, she might be the same as most mothers. After all, mothers are all heroes. But for myself, when I undergo some difficulties in life, I think of my mother. She inspires me to cheer up and face up to my responsibilities.
